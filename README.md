# MouseGhost
A square "ghost" that chases the user mouse!

This "Ghost" follows the user mouse and is actively trying to block the user from clicking anything on their monitor.
The "ghost" works by remembering the coordinated of the mouse last location, after that by delaying the "ghost" movement we get the elusion of the "ghost" following our mouse foot steps. 

This is only a concept for game that I am sometimes working on! Feel free to use it in your own way!
